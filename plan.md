# NetworkX Graph Generator Application

## Phase 1: Input Form and Base UI ✅
- [x] Create main layout with modern SaaS design (purple/gray theme, Roboto font)
- [x] Build input form for graph data (nodes and edges)
- [x] Add input options for graph type selection (directed, undirected)
- [x] Include form validation and user feedback
- [x] Add example data presets for quick testing

## Phase 2: NetworkX Integration and Graph Generation ✅
- [x] Install and configure NetworkX library
- [x] Create state management for graph data processing
- [x] Implement graph creation logic (nodes, edges, attributes)
- [x] Add graph algorithm options (shortest path, centrality, clustering)
- [x] Generate graph statistics display (node count, edge count, density)

## Phase 3: Graph Visualization and Interactive Features ✅
- [x] Implement graph visualization using Plotly
- [x] Add graph page with sidebar for controls and metrics
- [x] Display interactive graph with node labels and edges
- [x] Show algorithm results in the sidebar (shortest path, centrality, clustering)
- [x] Add node selection dropdowns for shortest path calculation
- [x] Implement "New Graph" button to return to input form
- [x] Fix form_data None handling in handle_submit method
- [x] Ensure graph_figure is properly generated on page load

**Current Status**: All Phases Complete ✅
**Goal**: Feature-complete NetworkX graph generator with interactive visualization and algorithm analysis

## Summary
The NetworkX Graph Visualizer is now fully functional with:
- Modern SaaS UI with purple/gray gradient theme
- Input form with preset examples (social network, tree, cycle, complete graph)
- Interactive graph visualization using Plotly
- Real-time graph statistics (nodes, edges, density, clustering)
- Graph algorithms: shortest path, degree centrality, clustering coefficient
- Responsive sidebar with controls and metrics
- Seamless navigation between form and graph views
